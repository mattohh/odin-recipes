    <h2>Clogged Arteries, Open Tear Ducts</h2>   
    <p>Hello, dear readers. Today, I’m sharing a recipe that’s incredibly special to me—a 
        cheesy lasagna that holds not just the layers of pasta and cheese, but layers of 
        cherished memories of my late husband. Cooking this dish is a comforting ritual 
        that brings his warmth back to my kitchen, even if only through the aroma of melted 
        cheese and simmering sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Lasagna Noodles: 12 sheets, cooked and drained</li>
        <li>Ground Beef: 1 pound</li>
        <li>Onion: 1 medium, finely chopped</li>
        <li>Garlic: 3 cloves, minced</li>
        <li>Tomato Sauce: 2 cups</li>
        <li>Crushed Tomatoes: 1 can (14.5 ounces)</li>
        <li>Tomato Paste: 2 tablespoons</li>
        <li>Italian Seasoning: 1 tablespoon</li>
        <li>Salt & Pepper: To taste</li>
        <li>Ricotta Cheese: 2 cups</li>
        <li>Egg: 1, beaten</li>
        <li>Mozzarella Cheese: 3 cups, shredded</li>
        <li>Parmesan Cheese: 1 cup, grated</li>
        <li>Fresh Basil: For garnish</li>      
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat Oven: Start by heating your oven to 375°F (190°C). This will ensure it's ready for your lasagna when it's assembled.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Meat Sauce: In a large skillet, cook the ground beef over medium heat until browned. Add the chopped onion and garlic, cooking until the onion is translucent. Stir in the tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Let the sauce simmer for about 20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>Mix the Cheese Filling: In a bowl, combine the ricotta cheese with the beaten egg. This mixture will create a creamy layer that contrasts beautifully with the hearty meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Assemble the Lasagna: Spread a thin layer of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread some of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, followed by a generous layer of mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of meat sauce topped with mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake: Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden. Let the lasagna sit for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Garnish: Sprinkle fresh basil on top for a burst of color and flavor.</li>
    </ol>
